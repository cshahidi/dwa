	<h1>Lead Generation & Tracking System</h1>
    <h5>
		CSCI E-75 Project 4 Proposal<br>
		Real Estate Lead Generation & Tracking System<br>
		Camran Shahidi
    </h5>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The application will form the foundation of the website for the small real estate acquisition
	   business that I have co-founded.  In addition to being informational, the website is being 
	   designed with the goal of growing the business.  The primary focus of this implementation will 
	   be on the Home Page, the Partners page and the Principals page.  The Partners page will include
	   an interactive lead generation tool for partners (direct sellers and bird dogs) to fill in with 
	   their real estate "hot leads". These leads will then be entered into the MySQL database. The 
	   Principals - i.e. internal staff - will then access and evaluate these leads for future 
	   action. The principals will then decide whether they will pursue, hold or reject any leads.  The 
	   project will of course be expanded in the future to complete the remaining web pages.
	</p>
	<h4>Supported Features:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>P2: User account creation and login, for both "Partners" and "Principals" closed user groups.</li>
		<li>P2: PHP class framework and MySQL database access to store and retrieve records.</li>
		<li>P2: Adding Leads will be same functionality as adding Posts in P2.</li>
		<li>JQuery validation plugin will be used for all new form input validation.</li>
		<li>JQuery plugins will also be used to provide client-side table sorting of database info 
			and possibly other beneficial user effects.</li>
		<li>P3: The Maximum Offer Calculator will be rolled into this app, as a submenu page.</li>
	</ul><br>
